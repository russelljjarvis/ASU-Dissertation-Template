\section{Specific Aims}


\subsubsection{1A:} Optimize reduced neuronal models across four different cell types, using two different classes of models:
 
 
 \subsubsection{1B:} By fitting  cellular models to experimental data, using spike waveform shape features,  we can then take optimized models, and characterize and cellular behaviors using Allen SDK and EFEL feature extraction software to evaluate electrical robustness across a large number of features.

\subsubsection{Aim 2:} Characterize and evaluate region-specific differences of cortical neuron-type data and models.
\subsubsection{2A:} Using large, publicly available datasets for neuron classes, we will characterize region-specific differences and evaluate neuron-type models for agreement with experimental data.
\subsubsection{2B:} Using models of neuron-types from different cortical regions we will identify the features underlying differences among neuron types and across regions, as well as the biophysical mechanisms that underlie those features.
