Aim 1: Characterize and evaluate region-specific differences of cortical neuron-type data and models.
1A: Using large, publicly available datasets for neuron classes, we will characterize region-specific differences and evaluate neuron-type models for agreement with experimental data.
1B: Using models of neuron-types from different cortical regions we will identify the features underlying differences among neuron types and across regions, as well as the biophysical mechanisms that underlie those features. 

Aim 2: Analyze and compare existing network models that represent different cortical regions.
2A: We will develop validation tests for comparing the behavior of network models to experimental data based on features commonly reported in the experimental literature.
2B: By comparing network models to experimental data, we will characterize and validate network behaviors and evaluate robustness.
