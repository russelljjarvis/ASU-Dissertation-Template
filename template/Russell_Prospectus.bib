	abstract = {We study the dynamics of the transition between the low- and high-firing states of the cortical slow oscillation by using intracellular recordings of the membrane potential from cortical neurons of rats. We investigate the evidence for a bistability in assemblies of cortical neurons playing a major role in the maintenance of this oscillation. We show that the trajectory of a typical transition takes an approximately exponential form, equivalent to the response of a resistor–capacitor circuit to a step-change in input. The time constant for the transition is negatively correlated with the membrane potential of the low-firing state, and values are broadly equivalent to neural time constants measured elsewhere. Overall, the results do not strongly support the hypothesis of a bistability in cortical neurons; rather, they suggest the cortical manifestation of the oscillation is a result of a step-change in input to the cortical neurons. Since there is evidence from previous work that a phase transition exists, we speculate that the step-change may be a result of a bistability within other brain areas, such as the thalamus, or a bistability among only a small subset of cortical neurons, or as a result of more complicated brain dynamics.},

In this paper we present results from an analog {VLSI} circuit that generates a hexagonal grid of activity using continuous attractor dynamics and transmits this pattern via neuron-like spikes. This circuit is a component of a larger system for modeling the neural circuits underlying mammalian spatial navigation.},

	abstract = {We present a novel framework for automatically constraining parameters of compartmental models of neurons, given a large set of experimentally measured responses of these neurons. In experiments, intrinsic noise gives rise to a large variability (e.g., in firing pattern) in the voltage responses to repetitions of the exact same input. Thus, the common approach of fitting models by attempting to perfectly replicate, point by point, a single chosen trace out of the spectrum of variable responses does not seem to do justice to the data. In addition, finding a single error function that faithfully characterizes the distance between two spiking traces is not a trivial pursuit. To address these issues, one can adopt a multiple objective optimization approach that allows the use of several error functions jointly. When more than one error function is available, the comparison between experimental voltage traces and model response can be performed on the basis of individual features of interest (e.g., spike rate, spike width). Each feature can be compared between model and experimental mean, in units of its experimental variability, thereby incorporating into the fitting this variability. We demonstrate the success of this approach, when used in conjunction with genetic algorithm optimization, in generating an excellent fit between model behavior and the firing pattern of two distinct electrical classes of cortical interneurons, accommodating and fast-spiking. We argue that the multiple, diverse models generated by this method could serve as the building blocks for the realistic simulation of large neuronal networks.},

However, knowledge on mechanisms underlying ripples is still scarce, in particular with respect to synaptic involvement of specific cell types. Here, we used cell-attached and whole-cell recordings in vitro to study activity of pyramidal cells and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons during ripples. O-{LM} cells received ripple-associated synaptic input that arrived delayed (3.3 ± 0.3 ms) with respect to the maximum amplitude of field ripples and was locked to the ascending phase of field oscillations (mean phase: 209 ± 6°). In line, O-{LM} cells episodically discharged late during ripples (∼6.5 ms after the ripple maximum), and firing was phase-locked to field oscillations (mean phase: 219 ± 9°). Our data unveil recruitment of O-{LM} neurons during ripples, suggesting a previously uncharacterized role of this cell type during sharp wave-associated activity.},

	abstract = {Mammals show a wide range of brain sizes, reflecting adaptation to diverse habitats. Comparing interareal cortical networks across brains of different sizes and mammalian orders provides robust information on evolutionarily preserved features and species-specific processing modalities. However, these networks are spatially embedded, directed, and weighted, making comparisons challenging. Using tract tracing data from macaque and mouse, we show the existence of a general organizational principle based on an exponential distance rule ({EDR}) and cortical geometry, enabling network comparisons within the same model framework. These comparisons reveal the existence of network invariants between mouse and macaque, exemplified in graph motif profiles and connection similarity indices, but also significant differences, such as fractionally smaller and much weaker long-distance connections in the macaque than in mouse. The latter lends credence to the prediction that long-distance cortico-cortical connections could be very weak in the much-expanded human cortex, implying an increased susceptibility to disconnection syndromes such as Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia. Finally, our data from tracer experiments involving only gray matter connections in the primary visual areas of both species show that an {EDR} holds at local scales as well (within 1.5 mm), supporting the hypothesis that it is a universally valid property across all scales and, possibly, across the mammalian class., The cortical network obeys common architectural principals in mouse and macaque. Differences include a relative decrease in long-range connections in the large brain of the macaque compared to the mouse., It was recently shown that the network of connections between different areas of the macaque cortex has strong structural specificity in terms of the strength of connections as a function of the distance between areas. This has led to a model of cortex connectivity that predicts many observed architectural features, including the existence of a strong core-periphery organization. When viewed across species, increases in brain size are accompanied by a relative decrease in connectivity, and thus an important question is whether there are architectural commonalities in the cortical networks within the mammalian branch. Here, based on tract tracing data from the folded macaque brain and the smooth mouse brain, we introduce a common model framework that allows network comparisons between species. We show that despite important differences in size, the cortices of both species share several network invariants, suggesting that the mammalian cortex exhibits universal architectural principals. This framework also captures differences between the two brains, including the fact that, unlike the macaque, the mouse core includes primary areas and that there is a relative decrease in the frequency of long-distance connections in the large macaque cortex compared to mouse. This approach allows network architectural extrapolations to the human cortex.},

	abstract = {Every act of information processing can in principle be decomposed into the component operations of information storage, transfer, and modification. Yet, while this is easily done for today’s digital computers, the application of these concepts to neural information processing was hampered by the lack of proper mathematical definitions of these operations on information. Recently, such definitions were given and the specific concept of local active information storage was successfully applied to the analysis and optimization of artificial neural systems. However, no attempt to measure local active information storage in neural data has been made to date. Here we measure local active information storage on a local scale in time and space in voltage sensitive dye imaging data from area 18 of the cat. We show that storage reflects neural properties such as stimulus preferences and surprise upon unexpected stimulus change, and in area 18 reflects the abstract concept of an ongoing stimulus despite the locally random nature of this stimulus. We suggest that {LAIS} will be a useful quantity to test theories of cortical function, such as predictive coding.},

	abstract = {Understanding the direction and quantity of information flowing in neuronal networks is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Brains and neuronal networks must at the same time store information about the world and react to information in the world. We sought to measure how the activity of the network alters information flow from inputs to output patterns. Using neocortical column neuronal network simulations, we demonstrated that networks with greater internal connectivity reduced input/output correlations from excitatory synapses and decreased negative correlations from inhibitory synapses, measured by Kendall's τ correlation. Both of these changes were associated with reduction in information flow, measured by normalized transfer entropy ({nTE}). Information handling by the network reflected the degree of internal connectivity. With no internal connectivity, the feedforward network transformed inputs through nonlinear summation and thresholding. With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. This dynamic contribution amounts to added information drawn from that stored in the network. At still higher internal synaptic strength, the network corrupted the external information, producing a state where little external information came through. The association of increased information retrieved from the network with increased gamma power supports the notion of gamma oscillations playing a role in information processing.},

Examining such collective dynamics at the level of single neuron spikes has remained, however, a considerable challenge. We found that the spiking history of small and randomly sampled ensembles ({\textasciitilde}20–200 neurons) could predict subsequent single neuron spiking with substantial accuracy in the sensorimotor cortex of humans and nonhuman behaving primates. Furthermore, spiking was better predicted by the ensemble’s history than by the ensemble’s instantaneous state (Ising models), emphasizing the role of temporal dynamics leading to spiking. Notably, spiking could be predicted not only by local ensemble spiking histories, but also by spiking histories in different cortical areas. These strong collective dynamics may provide a basis for understanding cognition and adaptive behavior at the level of coordinated spiking in cortical networks.},

We present a first-draft digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 ± 0.01 mm3 containing ∼31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form ∼8 million connections with ∼37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies.

At the same time, computational neuroscientists are finding it easier to access parallel hardware, such as multiprocessor personal computers, workstation clusters, and massively parallel supercomputers. The practical question is how to move a working network model from a single processor to parallel hardware. Here we show how to make this transition for models implemented with {NEURON}, in such a way that the final result will run and produce numerically identical results on either serial or parallel hardware. This allows users to develop and debug models on readily available local resources, then run their code without modification on a parallel supercomputer.},

	abstract = {While the adult human brain has approximately 8.8x10{\textasciicircum}10 neurons, this number is dwarfed by its 1x10{\textasciicircum}15 synapses. From the point of view of neuromorphic engineering and neural simulation in general this makes the simulation of these synapses a particularly complex problem. {SpiNNaker} is a digital, neuromorphic architecture designed for simulating large-scale spiking neural networks at speeds close to biological real-time. Current solutions for simulating spiking neural networks on {SpiNNaker} are heavily inspired by work on distributed high-performance computing. However, while {SpiNNaker} shares many characteristics with such distributed systems, its component nodes have much more limited resources and, as the system lacks global synchronization, the computation performed on each node must complete within a fixed time step. We first analyze the performance of the current {SpiNNaker} neural simulation software and identify several problems that occur when it is used to simulate networks of the type often used to model the cortex which contain large numbers of sparsely connected synapses. We then present a new, more flexible approach for mapping the simulation of such networks to {SpiNNaker} which solves many of these problems. Finally we analyze the performance of our new approach using both benchmarks, designed to represent cortical connectivity, and larger, functional cortical models. In a benchmark network where neurons receive input from 8000 {STDP} synapses, our new approach allows more neurons to be simulated on each {SpiNNaker} core than has been previously possible. We also demonstrate that the largest plastic neural network previously simulated on neuromorphic hardware can be run in real time using our new approach: double the speed that was previously achieved. Additionally this network contains two types of plastic synapse which previously had to be trained separately but, using our new approach, can be trained simultaneously.},

	abstract = {The behavior of neural circuits is determined largely by the electrophysiological properties of the neurons they contain. Understanding the relationships of these properties requires the ability to first identify and catalog each property. However, information about such properties is largely locked away in decades of closed-access journal articles with heterogeneous conventions for reporting results, making it difficult to utilize the underlying data. We solve this problem through the {NeuroElectro} project: a Python library, {RESTful} {API}, and web application (at http://neuroelectro.org) for the extraction, visualization, and summarization of published data on neurons' electrophysiological properties. Information is organized both by neuron type (using neuron definitions provided by {NeuroLex}) and by electrophysiological property (using a newly developed ontology). We describe the techniques and challenges associated with the automated extraction of tabular electrophysiological data and methodological metadata from journal articles. We further discuss strategies for how to best combine, normalize and organize data across these heterogeneous sources. {NeuroElectro} is a valuable resource for experimental physiologists attempting to supplement their own data, for computational modelers looking to constrain their model parameters, and for theoreticians searching for undiscovered relationships among neurons and their properties.},

	abstract = {Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence. It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions made by human observers obey these stochastic resonance principles, by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial random noise stimulation ({tRNS}) while participants judged the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms presented at the fovea. We found that adding {tRNS} bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were just below perceptual threshold, but not when they were well below or above threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework, and showed that bilateral {tRNS} selectively increased the drift rate parameter, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by {tRNS}, and to show that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.},

	abstract = {Ion channels open and close stochastically. The fluctuation of these channels represents an intrinsic source of noise that affects the input-output properties of the neuron. We combined whole-cell measurements with biophysical modeling to characterize the intrinsic stochastic and electrical properties of single neurons as observed at the soma. We measured current and voltage noise in 18 d postembryonic cultured neurons from the rat hippocampus, at various subthreshold and near-threshold holding potentials in the presence of synaptic blockers. The observed current noise increased with depolarization, as ion channels were activated, and its spectrum demonstrated generalized 1/fbehavior. Exposure to {TTX} removed a significant contribution from Na+ channels to the noise spectrum, particularly at depolarized potentials, and the resulting spectrum was now dominated by a single Lorentzian (1/f2) component. By replacing the intracellular K+ with Cs+, we demonstrated that a major portion of the observed noise was attributable to K+ channels. We compared the measured power spectral densities to a 1-D cable model of channel fluctuations based on Markov kinetics. We found that a somatic compartment, in combination with a single equivalent cylinder, described the effective geometry from the viewpoint of the soma. Four distinct channel populations were distributed in the membrane and modeled as Lorentzian current noise sources. Using the {NEURON} simulation program, we summed up the contributions from the spatially distributed current noise sources and calculated the total voltage and current noise. Our quantitative model reproduces important voltage- and frequency-dependent features of the data, accounting for the 1/f behavior, as well as the effects of various blockers.},

	abstract = {Superficial dorsal horn ({SDH}) neurons in laminae I-{II} of the spinal cord play an important role in processing noxious stimuli. These neurons represent a heterogeneous population and are divided into various categories according to their action potential ({AP}) discharge during depolarizing current injection. We recently developed an in vivo mouse preparation to examine functional aspects of nociceptive processing and {AP} discharge in {SDH} neurons and to extend investigation of pain mechanisms to the genetic level of analysis. Not surprisingly, some in vivo data obtained at body temperature (37 degrees C) differed from those generated at room temperature (22 degrees C) in spinal cord slices. In the current study we examine how temperature influences {SDH} neuron properties by making recordings at 22 and 32 degrees C in transverse spinal cord slices prepared from L3-L5 segments of adult mice (C57Bl/6). Patch-clamp recordings ({KCH}(3){SO}(4) internal) were made from visualized {SDH} neurons. At elevated temperature all {SDH} neurons had reduced input resistance and smaller, briefer {APs}. Resting membrane potential and {AP} afterhyperpolarization amplitude were temperature sensitive only in subsets of the {SDH} population. Notably, elevated temperature increased the prevalence of neurons that did not discharge {APs} during current injection. These reluctant firing neurons expressed a rapid A-type potassium current, which is enhanced at higher temperatures and thus restrains {AP} discharge. When compared with previously published whole cell recordings obtained in vivo (37 degrees C) our results suggest that, on balance, in vitro data collected at elevated temperature more closely resemble data collected under in vivo conditions.},

	abstract = {Computational models in neuroscience typically contain many parameters that are poorly constrained by experimental data. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis provide rigorous procedures to quantify how the model output depends on this parameter uncertainty. Unfortunately, the application of such methods is not yet standard within the field of neuroscience. Here we present Uncertainpy, an open-source Python toolbox, tailored to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of neuroscience models. Uncertainpy aims to make it quick and easy to get started with uncertainty analysis, without any need for detailed prior knowledge. The toolbox allows uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis to be performed on already existing models without needing to modify the model equations or model implementation. Uncertainpy bases its analysis on polynomial chaos expansions, which are more efficient than the more standard Monte-Carlo based approaches. Uncertainpy is tailored for neuroscience applications by its built-in capability for calculating characteristic features in the model output. The toolbox does not merely perform a point-to-point comparison of the ``raw'' model output (e.g., membrane voltage traces), but can also calculate the uncertainty and sensitivity of salient model response features such as spike timing, action potential width, average interspike interval, and other features relevant for various neural and neural network models. Uncertainpy comes with several common models and features built in, and including custom models and new features is easy. The aim of the current paper is to present Uncertainpy to the neuroscience community in a user-oriented manner. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we perform an uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of three case studies relevant for neuroscience: the original Hodgkin-Huxley point-neuron model for action potential generation, a multi-compartmental model of a thalamic interneuron implemented in the {NEURON} simulator, and a sparsely connected recurrent network model implemented in the {NEST} simulator.},

	abstract = {In order to see the world with high spatial acuity, an animal must sample the visual image with many detectors that restrict their analyses to extremely small regions of space. The visual cortex must then integrate the information from these localized receptive fields to obtain a more global picture of the surrounding environment. We studied this process in single neurons within the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) of macaques using stimuli that produced conflicting local and global information about stimulus motion. Neuronal responses in alert animals initially reflected predominantly the ambiguous local motion features, but gradually converged to an unambiguous global representation. When the same animals were anaesthetized, the integration of local motion signals was markedly impaired even though neuronal responses remained vigorous and directional tuning characteristics were intact. Our results suggest that anaesthesia preferentially affects the visual processing responsible for integrating local signals into a global visual representation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes (±2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

	abstract = {For large-scale network simulations, it is often desirable to have computationally tractable, yet in a defined sense still physiologically valid neuron models. In particular, these models should be able to reproduce physiological measurements, ideally in a predictive sense, and under different input regimes in which neurons may operate in vivo. Here we present an approach to parameter estimation for a simple spiking neuron model mainly based on standard f–I curves obtained from in vitro recordings. Such recordings are routinely obtained in standard protocols and assess a neuron’s response under a wide range of mean-input currents. Our fitting procedure makes use of closed-form expressions for the firing rate derived from an approximation to the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire ({AdEx}) model. The resulting fitting process is simple and about two orders of magnitude faster compared to methods based on numerical integration of the differential equations. We probe this method on different cell types recorded from rodent prefrontal cortex. After fitting to the f–I current-clamp data, the model cells are tested on completely different sets of recordings obtained by fluctuating (“in vivo-like”) input currents. For a wide range of different input regimes, cell types, and cortical layers, the model could predict spike times on these test traces quite accurately within the bounds of physiological reliability, although no information from these distinct test sets was used for model fitting. Further analyses delineated some of the empirical factors constraining model fitting and the model’s generalization performance. An even simpler adaptive {LIF} neuron was also examined in this context. Hence, we have developed a “high-throughput” model fitting procedure which is simple and fast, with good prediction performance, and which relies only on firing rate information and standard physiological data widely and easily available.},

We seek to quantitatively evaluate the hypothesis that neocortex is a relatively homogeneous tissue, with smaller functional modules that perform a common computational function replicated across regions. We here focus on the mouse as a mammalian model organism with genetics, physiology, and behavior that can be readily studied and manipulated in the laboratory. We seek to describe the operation of cortical circuitry at the computational level by comprehensively cataloging and characterizing its cellular building blocks along with their dynamics and their cell type-specific connectivities. The project is also building large-scale experimental platforms (i.e., brain observatories) to record the activity of large populations of cortical neurons in behaving mice subject to visual stimuli. A primary goal is to understand the series of operations from visual input in the retina to behavior by observing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the corticothalamic system. We here focus on the contribution that computer modeling and theory make to this long-term effort.},
