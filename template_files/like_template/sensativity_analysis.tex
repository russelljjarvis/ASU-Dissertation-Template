\Section{Sensitivity Analysis and NeuronUnit Error Correlation}
Sensitivity Analysis was performed using three different combinations of model, with just one data driven suite of neuronunit tests. Sensativity analysis gives some indication of the difficulty of optimization problems.

Sensitivity Analysis was able to reveal if model parameters had second order effects, that is is the model behavior dependant on not just the single parameter, but also a second intermediary parameter, and this parameter. 

In the Izhivitch model many of nine model parameters demonstrated significant effects.
